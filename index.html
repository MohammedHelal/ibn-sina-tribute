                            <p>Ibn Sina, commonly known in the West as Avicenna, 
                                was a polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, 
                                astronomers, philosophers, and writers of the Islamic Golden Age, and the father of early modern medicine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He was a Muslim Peripatetic philosopher influenced by Greek Aristotelian philosophy. Of the 450 works 
                                he is believed to have written, around 240 have survived, including 150 on philosophy and 40 on medicine.

                            <p>
                                His most famous works are The Book of Healing, a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, 
                                and The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities
                                and remained in use as late as 1650.

                            <p>Ibn Sina wrote numerous books on the sciences and philosophy, the most famous of which is The Book of Healing.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Book of Healing is Ibn Sina's major work on science and philosophy, 
                                and is intended to "cure" or "heal" ignorance of the soul. Thus, despite its title, it is not concerned with medicine
                            </p>
                            <p>The book is divided into four parts: logic, natural sciences, mathematics (a quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy), 
                                and metaphysics. It was influenced by ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle; Hellenistic thinkers such as Ptolemy; 
                                and earlier Persian/Muslim scientists and philosophers, such as Al-Kindi (Alkindus), Al-Farabi (Alfarabi), and Al-Bīrūnī.
